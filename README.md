how the bots work

- notify bot
  
to get it working create a .env file inside the notify bot folder and input your bot key 
it works with command 
/notify [number (type of time {day, hour, min, sec. supports variations of them} ] [message] 
it will then send a dm to the user who did the command after that amount of time has elapsed

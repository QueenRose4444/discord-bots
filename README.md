how the bots work

‎ 

- notify bot

‎ 

  
to get it working edit the .env file by adding your discord token

it works with command 

/notify [number (type of time {day, hour, min, sec. supports variations of them} ] [message] 

it will then send a dm to the user who did the command after that amount of time has elapsed 



- message scraper bot


to get it working edit the .env file by adding your discord token

it works with command 

/scrape  [ limt number] if left empty itll do the whole channel

it will then scrape messages in the same channel the command is used in 

it will send the file to the user using a hidden message so only the user who performed the command can access the file
